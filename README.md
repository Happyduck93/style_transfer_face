# style_transfer_face

## Abstract
This project seeks to develop a deep learning model for producing pop art. The process involves using a combination of a human face image and a style image. To accomplish this, the project employs transfer learning methods, making use of the pretrained VGG19 model layers in PyTorch. These VGG19 layers are utilized to extract pertinent features from the images.
